# WinRelay Icon Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the application icon.

For a production build, you would need to:
1. Create or obtain a proper .ico file (32x32, 16x16 versions recommended)
2. Place it in the Resources folder as "icon.ico"
3. The application will automatically use it

The application will fall back to using the system default application icon if no custom icon is found.

Recommended icon specifications:
- Format: .ICO file
- Sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256 pixels
- Color depth: 32-bit (with alpha channel for transparency)
- Style: Simple, recognizable symbol related to window management

Icon design ideas:
- Overlapping rectangles representing windows
- Grid pattern for layout management
- Center-focused design for centering functionality
- Modern, minimalist style to match Windows 11 design language
